# BMI Calculator

## About the Project

**BMI Calculator** is a simple web-based application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their height (in cm) and weight (in kg). BMI is a measure used to determine whether a person is underweight, in the normal range, or overweight. The tool provides a quick and rough estimate of a user's physical fitness.
